Demonstration of my PHP / React abilities for Skiddle
</p>

### Built using 

- [Laravel v10](https://laravel.com/)
  *It is the most popular PHP framework. I have also done plenty of work with other PHP & Node.JS frameworks and with more proprietary codebases.*

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  *I have used React (DOM & Native) for a number of professional projects, including my own personal website. I have also used Vue.js, Angular.js and most other widely used JS frameworks.*

- [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/)
  *Inertia.js is a wonderful way to integrate a modern React user interface with the complete backend power of the Laravel framework. I recommend it for any new Laravel projects. I have also built plenty of API-driven projects.*

- [MUI Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/)
  *I would usually use [Blueprint.js](https://blueprintjs.com) for my personal projects and other homemade components for professional projects. But Material UI components seem a little more playful for this project.*
